## Welcome to Giftme ##

The GiftMe Backend repo can be found at github.com/menudevelopment/giftmebackendv2

Gift.Me is my personal passion project. The idea is simple. Create a site that allows people to collaboratively plan and send gifts. It is built with a Rails API backend and React and Redux on the front end. I believe that this project will be a great reflection of the kind of work you can expect from me, and will update this readme when it is closer to completion.
